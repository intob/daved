Daved is a command-line interface (CLI) for basic interaction with a dave
network. CLI may be started into one of multiple operating modes, and accepts
arguments to configure the execution. The default operating mode is running as
a node, participating in network gossip. It will listen for dats, as they are
gossipped randomly through the network, relaying them as in the protocol spec.

When running multiple instances of daved on one ip-address, random ports will
often cause packet filter collisions. I suggest using pre-defined ports in
this case.

Arguments, followed by default values:
-l [::]:0               Listen ip address and port (listen on every interface,
                        on a random available port)
-b :1992                Bootstrap to port (local machine inferred)
-b 3.255.246.69:1618    Bootstrap to ip:port
-s                      Start as seed node. Off by default.
-dcap 500000            Capacity of dat map held in memory.
-fcap 1000000           Capacity of cuckoo filter.
-v                      Verbose logging, grep by log path prefix.
-d 2                    For set command. Difficulty of poof-of-work.
-h                      For set command. Output only hash.

Try:
daved
daved -v | grep /d/pr

Or:
daved set hello_dave
A hash will be returned after the work & broadcast, with default difficulty.

daved get <HASH>
